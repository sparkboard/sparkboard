# LLM Code Style Preferences

## Clojure Style Guidelines

### Conditionals
- Use `if` for single condition checks, not `cond`
- Only use `cond` for multiple condition branches
- Prefer `if-let` and `when-let` for binding and testing a value in one step
- Consider `when` for conditionals with single result and no else branch
- consider `cond->`, and `cond->>`

### Variable Binding
- Minimize code points by avoiding unnecessary `let` bindings
- Only use `let` when a value is used multiple times or when clarity demands it
- Inline values used only once rather than binding them to variables
- Use threading macros (`->`, `->>`) to eliminate intermediate bindings

### Parameters & Destructuring
- Use destructuring in function parameters when accessing multiple keys
- Example: `[{:keys [::zloc ::match-form] :as ctx}]` for namespaced keys instead of separate `let` bindings
- Example: `[{:keys [zloc match-form] :as ctx}]` for regular keywords

### Control Flow
- Track actual values instead of boolean flags where possible
- Use early returns with `when` rather than deeply nested conditionals
- Return `nil` for "not found" conditions rather than objects with boolean flags

### Comments
- Do not include comments in generated code, unless specifically asked to.

### Nesting
- Minimize nesting levels by using proper control flow constructs
- Use threading macros (`->`, `->>`) for sequential operations

### Function Design
- Functions should generally do one thing
- Pure functions preferred over functions with side effects
- Return useful values that can be used by callers
- smaller functions make edits faster and reduce the number of tokens
- reducing tokens makes me happy

### Library Preferences
- Prefer `clojure.string` functions over Java interop for string operations
  - Use `str/ends-with?` instead of `.endsWith`
  - Use `str/starts-with?` instead of `.startsWith`  
  - Use `str/includes?` instead of `.contains`
  - Use `str/blank?` instead of checking `.isEmpty` or `.trim`
- Follow Clojure naming conventions (predicates end with `?`)
- Favor built-in Clojure functions that are more expressive and idiomatic

### REPL best pratices
- Always reload namespaces with `:reload` flag: `(require '[namespace] :reload)`
- Always change into namespaces that you are working on

### Testing Best Practices
- Always reload namespaces before running tests with `:reload` flag: `(require '[namespace] :reload)`
- Test both normal execution paths and error conditions

### Using Shell Commands
- Prefer the idiomatic `clojure.java.shell/sh` for executing shell commands
- Always handle potential errors from shell command execution
- Use explicit working directory for relative paths: `(shell/sh "cmd" :dir "/path")`
- For testing builds and tasks, run `clojure -X:test` instead of running tests piecemeal
- When capturing shell output, remember it may be truncated for very large outputs
- Consider using shell commands for tasks that have mature CLI tools like diffing or git operations

- **Context Maintenance**:
  - Use `clojure_eval` with `:reload` to ensure you're working with the latest code
  - always switch into `(in-ns ...)` the namespace that you are working on
  - Keep function and namespace references fully qualified when crossing namespace boundaries
