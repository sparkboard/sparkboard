  "Route definitions. Routes are identified by their keyword-id. Options:

  :view  - symbol pointing to a (client) view for the single-page app
  :query - symbol pointing to a (server) function providing data for the route

  Views and queries are resolved lazily using shadow.lazy (cljs) and requiring-resolve (clj)
  This lets us require this namespace without causing circular dependencies."
